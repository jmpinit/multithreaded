      <h1>Parks x Needle </h1>
      <p>Parks x Needle is a punch needled journal of NYC’s ecologically important natural resources in the five boroughs. This project hopes to provide the audience a novel and cozy experience of the expansive parks at NYC, as well as spark a sense of exploration and play.</p>

      <p>Due to travel restrictions amid the pandemic, Sally found herself alone and away from her family in Korea during the holiday season. In search for some comfort and quiet contemplation, she decided to spend time with the wildlife of the city. These tufted series is a reflection of her observations and emotions at a selection of parks out of the 138 NYC Parks with wildlife zones. </p>

      <p>There are four key components in producing these tactile visualizations: NYC Parks for providing the location and shape data of the wildlife zones, Sally’s park excursions for filling in the shapes with colors that reflect her observations and emotions at these zones, Houdini (a visual effects software) for generating paths that outline the parks’ wildlife zones, and Owen’s customized tufting gun that is mounted and controlled by a robot arm.
